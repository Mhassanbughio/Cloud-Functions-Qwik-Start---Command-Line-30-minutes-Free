gcloud is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

You can list the active account name with this command:

gcloud auth list

You can list the project ID with this command:

gcloud config list project

Create a function

To create a cloud function:
In the Cloud Shell command line, create a directory for the function code.

mkdir gcf_hello_world

Move to the gcf_hello_world directory.

cd gcf_hello_world

Create and open index.js to edit.

nano index.js

Copy the following into the index.js file

/**
* Background Cloud Function to be triggered by Pub/Sub.
* This function is exported by index.js, and executed when
* the trigger topic receives a message.
*
* @param {object} data The event payload.
* @param {object} context The event metadata.
*/

Exit nano (Ctrl+x) and save (Y) the file.


exports.helloWorld = (data, context) => {
const pubSubMessage = data;
const name = pubSubMessage.data
    ? Buffer.from(pubSubMessage.data, 'base64').toString() : "Hello World";
console.log(`My Cloud Function: ${name}`);
};

Create a cloud storage bucket
Use the following command to create a new cloud storage bucket for your function:

gsutil mb -p [PROJECT_ID] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

PROJECT_ID is the Project ID in the connection details of this lab

Deploy your function
When deploying a new function, you must specify --trigger-topic, --trigger-bucket, or --trigger-http. When deploying an update to an existing function, 
the function keeps the existing trigger unless otherwise specified.

For this lab, you'll set the --trigger-topic as hello_world.

Deploy the function to a pub/sub topic named hello_world, replacing [BUCKET_NAME] with the name of your bucket:

gcloud functions deploy helloWorld \
  --stage-bucket [BUCKET_NAME] \
  --trigger-topic hello_world \
  --runtime nodejs8

If prompted, enter Y to allow unauthenticated invocations of a new function.

Verify the status of the function.

gcloud functions describe helloWorld

An ACTIVE status indicates that the function has been deployed.

entryPoint: helloWorld
eventTrigger:
  eventType: providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish
  failurePolicy: {}
  resource:
...
status: ACTIVE
